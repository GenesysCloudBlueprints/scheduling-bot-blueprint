This blueprint provides a bot flow that books an appointment to a user. Connected with AWS Lambda that calls a scheduling application, the bot highlights conversational AI integration with back-end services, offering a reusable pattern for scheduling scenarios across industries like healthcare, financial, customer services, etc.
